# NYC Rat Sightings Analysis Project

## Introduction

New York City is known for its urban wildlife, with rats being one of the cityâ€™s most infamous animal mascots. Despite their negative reputation, rats play a significant role in the ecosystem by consuming food waste. NYC maintains detailed data on animal sightings, including rats, which is publicly available. This project aims to analyze NYC rat sightings data to gain insights into rat populations and distribution across the city.

## Objectives

- Analyze NYC rat sightings data to understand patterns and trends in rat populations.
- Identify areas with high rat activity and factors contributing to rat infestations.
- Provide recommendations for rat control and management strategies based on the analysis findings.

## Data Source

The NYC rat sightings data is sourced from the NYC OpenData platform, where it is publicly available. The dataset contains information on reported rat sightings, including location, date, and time.

## Analysis Approach

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Explore and clean the rat sightings dataset to remove inconsistencies and missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of rat sightings across different boroughs, neighborhoods, and time periods.
   - Identify any patterns or correlations in the data.
3. **Spatial Analysis**:
   - Utilize geospatial analysis techniques to visualize rat sightings on a map of NYC.
   - Identify hotspots or clusters of rat activity in specific areas.
4. **Temporal Analysis**:
   - Analyze temporal trends in rat sightings over time, including seasonal variations.
5. **Statistical Modeling (Optional)**:
   - Apply statistical modeling techniques to identify factors influencing rat populations and predict future trends.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Summarize key findings from the analysis and provide actionable recommendations for rat control and management in NYC.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Geopandas for data manipulation and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and documentation.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional datasets, such as demographic and environmental data, to enhance the analysis.
- Explore advanced modeling techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, for predictive analysis of rat populations.
- Collaborate with local authorities and stakeholders to implement targeted rat control measures based on the analysis findings.

## Conclusion

The NYC Rat Sightings Analysis project aims to provide insights into rat populations and distribution in New York City. By leveraging publicly available data and advanced analytics techniques, the project contributes to understanding urban wildlife dynamics and informs strategies for rat control and management.
